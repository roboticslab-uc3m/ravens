# Ravens for SoftGym

Requires [SoftAgent](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/softagent).

## Install

Install instructions in [google-research/ravens](https://github.com/google-research/ravens).

This fork is intended to **train** and **test** transporter nets with our [SoftGym](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/softgym) fork. Also copy this repo 
in your SoftAgent main directory, so it looks like this:

    ```

    ├── softgym
    ```
